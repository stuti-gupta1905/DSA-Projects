#  Graph_Based Route Planner

A graph-based route planner that simulates the core navigation logic by modeling cities as nodes and roads as weighted edges.

The project computes the shortest route and total travel distance
using Dijkstra's algorithm, with support for dynamic road blocking.

Features :-
Cities represented as graph nodes
Roads represented as weighted edges
Shortest path computation
Path reconstruction
Dynamic road blocking
Traversal using BFS and DFS
