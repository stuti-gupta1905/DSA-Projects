# DSA Projects in C++

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms based projects
implemented in C++.

Each folder represents a major DSA topic, with individual projects
inside subfolders.

## DSA Notes

I maintain structured notes for each DSA topic.  
You can check them here:

- [Arrays](DSA-Notes/Arrays.md)
- [Binary Search](DSA-Notes/BinarySearch.md)
- [Graphs](DSA-Notes/Graphs.md)
- [Linked List](DSA-Notes/LinkedList.md)
